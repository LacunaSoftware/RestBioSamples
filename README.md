# RestBio Samples

This repository contains sample projects demonstrating the usage of Lacuna Software's **Biometric APIs/SDKs** in various programming languages and frameworks.

## Getting Started

To run a sample, you need to start **one backend** and **one frontend** project. All backend projects run on **port 5078**, and all frontend projects run on **port 4200**.

### 1. Choose a backend:

* [.NET](backend/dotnet/)
* [Java](backend/java/)

Start the backend project of your choice. It will listen on `http://localhost:5078`.

### 2. Choose a frontend:

* [Angular](frontend/angular/)
* [Generic (pure HTML/JS)](frontend/generic/)

Start the frontend project of your choice. It will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.
