# RestBio samples for .NET

This folder contains **.NET sample projects** demonstrating the usage of Lacuna Software's
**Biometric APIs/SDKs** in various programming languages and frameworks.

For other languages, please visit the [repository root](https://github.com/LacunaSoftware/RestBioSamples).

Default sample (ASP.NET CORE)
----------------------------

A sample using **ASP.NET CORE** can be found in the folder [core](core/).

Steps to execute the sample:

1. [Download the project](https://github.com/LacunaSoftware/RestBioSamples/archive/master.zip)
   or clone the repository

1. Open the folder of the desired project `core`

1. Open the solution file (.sln) on Visual Studio
   
1. Run the solution. Make sure your system allows automatic Nuget package restore (if it doesn't,
   manually restore the packages).
